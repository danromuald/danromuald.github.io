I am a Business Development Management Lead for [AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/) platforms. I lead strategic business development initiatives for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Engines, helping folks build end-to-end AI solutions at scale on cloud technologies. It's a fun ride, working with folks that build advanced machine learning solutions every day. Prior to assuming this role, I joined AWS in 2013 as a Big Data and Devops Manager where I built two teams of specialists on the Hadoop ecosystem, and CI/CD technologies. So I have a Business focus, with an engineering and engineering management background; which is fairly common today. I spent over a decade deploying and supporting solutions around the world, that got me to live and work in over 28 countries; picking up different languages and cultures, making me a melting pot. I hold a BSc in Physics and Computer Sciences, and over 12 years of experience building and managing engineering teams in emerging technologies.
