title: Opslife!
---

Oh well... Hello ML world! Machine Learning is an exciting field and I'm glad to spend my days in this domain. I like the term Ops life because I strongly believe that once you're done understanding the theory and basic principles of everything, what is left to do -- and what is often the most important thing to do -- is to operationalize it. The story is not different for Machine Learning. So I decided to create this blog for my ops life in ML, essentially a medium to share my tips and tricks, hacks and different gems in the practice.
